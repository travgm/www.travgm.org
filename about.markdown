title: About
---
I have spent most of my life as a software developer even from the young age of 12 when my cousin who worked at Honeywell taught me Python. I went on to learn Qbasic, Visual Basic, C, Assembly and when I was 16 years old I wrote my own 16-bit realmode OS called Xudus.

I have worked professionally in various industries from Government, Healthcare and now the Credit industry. In 2014 I worked for a government contractor on the VIPER Cyber team where we did a lot of R&D work and I got to work on various GPS protocols including the F16 EGI device.

I then worked for Leetcoin which was on the cusp of bringing bitcoin to the Esports industry in Las Vegas. We built a gaming platform that allowed individuals to bet using Bitcoin and compete in tournments.

I made a transition to Healthcare and worked for Bind (Now Surest) health insurance as a Backend Software Engineer where we took on some unique challenges and created what I believe a great health insurance opportunity.

I was lucky enough when I worked for a local manufacturing company in Las Vegas to have the opportunity to program in Haskell professionally and create some internal tooling for the IT department and various departments of the company.

In 2022 I ended up in the credit industry working as a Senior Software Engineer where I have been able to work on multiple projects across different teams helping architect new solutions and improve existing ones.
